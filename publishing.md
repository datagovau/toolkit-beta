<h2>Publishing open data</h2>
<p>A fundamental aspect of open data is that it’s available for re-use with formats and licencing that allow others to re-use and remix the data.

## Principles

Adapted from the [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/), [signed by Australia in 2017](https://blog.data.gov.au/news-media/blog/australia-adopts-international-open-data-charter).

### Open by default
The [Australian Government commits](!https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/aust_govt_public_data_policy_statement_1.pdf) to optimise the use and reuse of public data; to release non
sensitive data as open by default; and to collaborate with the private and research sectors to
extend the value of public data for the benefit of the Australian public.

Public data includes all data collected by government entities for any purposes including;
government administration, research or service delivery. Non-sensitive data is anonymised data
that does not identify an individual or breach privacy or security requirements.

### Timely and comprehensive
Open data is only valuable if it’s still relevant. Getting information published quickly and in a comprehensive way is central to its potential for success. As much as possible governments should provide data in its original, unmodified form.

### Accessible and usable
Ensure that data is [machine readable, easy to find, free of charge and under an open license](/reference/principles/3-accessible-usable).

### Comparable and Interoperable
Use commonly-agreed [data standards](/reference/principles/4-data-standards) to make sure that your data is widely used.

### For Improved Governance & Citizen Engagement
Data has a multiplier effect. The more quality datasets you have access to, and the easier it is for them to talk to each other, the more potential value you can get from them. Commonly-agreed data standards play a crucial role in making this happen.

### For Inclusive Development and Innovation
Finally, open data can help spur inclusive economic development. For example, greater access to data can make farming more efficient, or it can be used to tackle climate change. Finally, we often think of open data as just about improving government performance, but there’s a whole universe out there of entrepreneurs making money off the back of open data.
