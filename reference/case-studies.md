<h2>Case studies</h2>
<p>The collection of links below demonstrate the breadth and value of the ways that data.gov.au and other open data resources are currently used.
</p>

<h3>NationalMap</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://nationalmap.gov.au/">NationalMap</a> is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data from government agencies. It is designed to:
</p>
<ul><li>Provide easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
<li>Facilitate the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
<li>Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li></ul>
<h3>Trove</h3>
<p><a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a> brings together content from libraries, museums, archives and other research organisations with tools to explore and build. Trove is a growing repository of full text digital resources, but it is also an aggregation of metadata for users to build upon, a set of services, and a community in its own right.
</p>
<h3>Energy Rating Tools</h3>
<p>A joint initiative of Australian Commonwealth, State and Territory and New Zealand governments has produced an energy efficiency dataset for over seven million major household appliances sold in Australia and New Zealand every year.
The Department of Industry has used this data to create a <a href="http://www.energyrating.gov.au/for-consumers/energy-ratings-mobile-app/">mobile app</a> to help households choose energy efficient appliances.
The dataset has also been built upon for private projects such as the <a href="http://energycalculator.meteor.com/">energy calculator</a> created by Jonathon Moffatt and Wai Liu for GovHack 2014.
</p><p>Opening the energy ratings data has:
</p>
<ul><li>Created an automatically-created API (Application Program Interface) for the dataset from data.gov.au, saving the cost of commissioning an API and purchasing the servers to host the dataset</li>
<li>Helped retailers to automatically update the Energy Rating Labels of appliances for sale on their website and reduce the risk of a Trade Practices Act breach for displaying inaccurate or misleading rating information</li>
<li>Empowered the community to build on the data. A range of GovHack 2014 projects demonstrated the potential to mix energy rating data with other datasets for great outcomes, including the prototype for the Energy Calculator and Comparison Tool, which demonstrated the potential to use the energy rating dataset to help households crunch the costs of their appliances.</li></ul>
<h3>Whole-of-Government Data Analytics Centre of Excellence</h3>
<p>The WofG Data Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE) was established by the Australian Taxation Office as a space to build analytics capability across government. The purpose of the CoE is to enable a common capability framework for analytics, as well as an opportunity to share technical knowledge, skills and tools. The CoE also helps build collaborative arrangements with tertiary institutions to aid the development of analytics professionals. The CoE has developed a website which provides information about data analytics at: <a href="http://analyticsspace.net.au/">http://analyticsspace.net.au/</a>
