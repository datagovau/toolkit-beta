Data has a multiplier effect. The more quality datasets you have access to, and the easier it is for them to talk to each other, the more potential value you can get from them. Commonly-agreed data standards play a crucial role in making this happen.

## Data and metadata standards

- [Health, housing and community services statistics and information](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/)
- [Open Data Standards Directory (International)](https://datastandards.directory/)
- [Open Council Data](https://opencouncildata.org/)

Please send PRs to add new data and metadata standards.
