<h2>Choosing data sets to publish</h2>
<h3>What data should be published?</h3>
<p>Open data is about giving open access to data that is:
</p>
<ul><li>Structured – the data is recorded in a uniform way based on a common model. This can be as simple as a spreadsheet with rules around how the data is recorded. For example, if one of the inputs is the state or territory that a program is run in, there could be a rule that the state is recorded as ‘WA’ rather than ‘Western Australia’ or ‘Wstn Aus’. See <a href="/publishing-your-data#creating_datasets" title="Publishing your data">creating data sets</a> for more information about structuring data.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Machine readable – the data is digitised and available in a format that can be read automatically by machines for retrieval, downloading, indexing and searching. See <a href="/publishing-your-data#saved_in_an_open_format" title="Publishing your data">data formats</a> for more information about machine readable formats.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Licenced to minimise the limits on how people can use and redistribute the data. See <a href="/publishing-your-data#licensing_your_data" title="Publishing your data">licencing your data</a> for more information.</li></ul>
<p>There are three broad data types found in Government Agencies: 
</p>
<ul><li>Raw data generated out of business as usual activities – such as spatial data from a program, energy ratings data, crime statistics, administration data, etc. Often this data is stored in databases and primarily used in business applications.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Processed data – new data that results from a process such as tables from annual reports, FOI logs, other data generated for the functions and running of agencies. This could also be an aggregate view of a raw data set, fit for public access.</li></ul>
<ul><li>System data – data that is automatically generated from other processes such as web analytics, project management, access logs and other systems.</li></ul>
<p>Identifying different data across your organisation means getting out of the traditional data teams and looks at other datasets that exist and how you can leverage them to improve services, policies and efficiencies.
</p>
<h3>How should I prioritise data?</h3>
<p>If your organisation is looking for data to start publishing, you can identify popular or easily opened data sets by:
</p>
<ul><li>Analysing FOI, Parliamentary and external helpdesk requests for common requests. This could help to reduce time and resources spent on providing the same data to individual requests, as well as identifying popular data sets for publication.</li>
<li>Looking at information the agency already publishes, either in data form or PDF form, for some quick results. Publishing the data on data.gov.au will improve accessibility, reuse, discoverability and the ability for your agency to reuse the data. For example, the tables from your annual report, budget, grants, administrative data or mandatory reporting are all useful.</li>
<li>Assessing what data sets exist across your agency and identifying a top 10 that would provide greater economic, transparency or policy benefits if made publicly available.</li>
<li>Identify where you need data to deliver a new service or application and consider making the data feed publicly available to cut costs in your service delivery and to enable external services based on your data.</li>
<li>In all new systems consider the data that is created and how you can best reuse and appropriate expose the data from the start.</li></ul>
<p>Your entity’s priorities for opening data should be identified as part of a broader open data strategy.
</p>
<h3>Sourcing data for publication</h3>
<p>A core theme of the current policies that address the management of public sector information is that government information should be managed as a national resource and made available for reuse unless there are good reasons not to (eg the data could identify individuals). To achieve this, your organisation can:
</p>
<ul><li>Consider whether upcoming publications contain information that is suitable for release in an open data format. Many government reports include agency data about financial, economic, social or regulatory activity or trends, but present the data in formats unsuited to reuse (eg publishing spreadsheets in a PDF file rather than a reusable spread sheet format). To fix this, consider publishing the underlying raw data alongside the report in a reusable open data format.
<ul><li>For example, as part of the budget process the Government now publishes <a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/budget-2014-15-tables-and-data">financial data from the portfolio budget statements</a> in a reusable format on data.gov.au in addition to the statements themselves which are available on departmental websites.</li></ul></li>
<li>Consider whether agency websites and mobile apps that present information to the public could also be released in data form. For example, the <a href="http://humanservices.findnearest.com.au/">Department of Human Services’ (DHS) Service Locator tool</a> allows people to find their nearest Centrelink, Medicare or Child Support location. DHS released the <a href="https://data.gov.au/organization/departmentofhumanservices">raw Service Locator geospatial data</a> on data.gov.au. This makes the data available to the public to build their own apps using the data. <br>Another example is the Department of Finance’s release of <a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/historical-australian-government-contract-data">historical government contract data</a> from the <a href="http://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.reports.listCNWeeklyExport">AusTender website</a> on data.gov.au.</li>
<li>Assess whether any material they have already published online in publications, websites or apps is suitable for release as open data. This could include material published as part of the FOI Act Information Publication Scheme or in an agency disclosure log.</li></ul>
