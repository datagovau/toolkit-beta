<h2>Creating an open data strategy</h2>
<p>An organisation’s open data strategy is a practical document that identifies how the government’s commitment to open data applies within an individual organisation.
</p><p>Organisations can use their open data strategies to identify the value they put on open data, how they will act on open data commitments, the data that will and won’t be made available (for example, data may be withheld for privacy or national security purposes), how they will interact with open data stakeholders such as contractors and data users, and an indicative order and timetable for the data to be made available.
If you are creating an open data strategy for your own organisation, the examples below and the open data self-assessment  will help to identify the best strategic open data goals for your organisation based on the level of progress to date. The page on choosing data sets to publish  may also be useful for prioritising the publication of your organisation’s data.

<h3>Examples of organisations’ open data strategies</h3>
<p>The Queensland Government has published its open data strategies for others to learn from. See the website for strategies you can use as a guide.
If your organisation has published an open data strategy that you would like to share, please send a link to <a href="mailto:spatial@communications.gov.au">spatial@communications.gov.au</a> and we will add your strategy to this page.
